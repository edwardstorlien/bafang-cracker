# bafang-cracker
Arduino code for cracking password of Bafang display.

See blog post about how it works and how to use it:

Note: This is only my improved version of the code found in the blog post

Important: The code prints out 1 higher than the actually correct code in the serial monitor. For instance, if the serial monitor says 1313 is the correct code, the correct code is actually 1312. I haven't fixed this bug yet.
